Futuretek Coding Survey
===================


Hey,
welcome to our little coding challenge. As you were informed, the survey will take place online and if you read this you have already reached the code repository.

*Setup:*
> - You will find the sources and the compiled APK of a small sample project. 
> - If you are familiar with Android you should download only the Android Studio IDE package otherwise you could download a package including the Android SDK as well. Download the Android Studio from this link: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
> - **Please mind the time**. If you check in your code more than 3h after you are being sent the repo-link you will get a penalty


*Assignment:*

> Mandatory:

> 1. There is a bug in the name input dialogue. Find it, fix it, test it
> 2. The "Next" button on the first activity should be activated only if the user name is entered and stored to the database. Find it, fix it, test it
> 3. Add a Skill "Software Developer" to the initial skill list.


> Optional:

> 4. Implement a functionality with which the user can insert a skill himself.
> 5. Implement a functionality with which the user can update a skill.
> 6. Modify the app to tell your own story you would like to share with futuretek.

When you are done, check in your code to a github project of yours, compile a working APK(project/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk), write a short release-document and mail to challenge@futuretek.ch with the link to your project. Do not amend after you have mailed.

Please note that we do not exclusively rate how many of the points you have covered but also approach, documentation and quality.
